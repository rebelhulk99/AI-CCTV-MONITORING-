# AI CCTV Monitoring System

## ðŸ“Œ Description
An intelligent AI-powered CCTV monitoring system designed to enhance security by providing real-time surveillance with advanced features such as facial recognition, object detection, anomaly detection, and automatic alerting. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze live video feeds, identify suspicious activities, and reduce false alarms, enabling efficient and proactive security monitoring.

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-time person recognition and biometric security using facial recognition technology
- Object detection including humans, vehicles, and other objects with behavioral analysis
- Anomaly and unusual activity detection with automated alerts to security personnel
- Automatic license plate recognition (ANPR) for vehicle monitoring
- Reduction of false alarms and human error in surveillance
- Cloud integration for storage and remote access
- High accuracy performance in various environmental conditions such as low light and weather challenges

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript (optional for UI)
- AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch
- Video Processing: OpenCV, FFmpeg
- Database: MongoDB / SQL (for storing metadata and logs)
- Cloud Platform: AWS / Azure / Google Cloud (for remote storage and alerts)
- Frontend: React or Angular (optional for dashboard)
- Tools: Docker for containerization, Git for version control
